### **Inspiration**

I wanted a compact macropad that could help me with repetitive tasks whilst coding and editing videos for people. This is a simple 4-key macropad to do just that.

### **Challenges**

This project involved learning KiCad, firmware setup, and Fusion360 for the first time! I've had previous experience using OnShape but apart from that everything else was completely new to me!

### **Specifications**

**BOM:**  
- **4× Cherry MX Switches**  
  *Footprint:* SW_Cherry_MX_1.00u_PCB  

- **2× SK6812 Mini LEDs**  
  *Footprint:* LED_SK6812MINI_PLCC4_3.5×3.5mm  

- **1× Seeed XIAO RP2040**  
  *Footprint:* XIAO-RP2040-DIP  

**Other components & files:**  
- 4× Keycaps  
- M3 heat-set inserts  
- M3 screws (length used in your model)
- Firmware: KMK  
- `Top Case.stl`
